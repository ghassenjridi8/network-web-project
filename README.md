## Introduction

This project provides an introduction to creating and deploying a Java-based web app using AWS, especially their CI/CD tools.  
The deployment pipeline around the Java web app in this repo is invisible to the end user but makes a huge impact by automating the software release process.

- I’m doing this project to learn more about CI/CD and gain hands-on experience automating the flow from code development to deployment.

## Technologies

Here’s what I’m using for this project:

- **Amazon EC2**: I’m developing my web app on Amazon EC2 virtual servers so that software development and deployment happen entirely in the cloud.  
- **Key pairs, SSH connections, Git, Maven, and Java**
- **VS Code**: For my IDE, I chose VS Code. It connects directly to my development EC2 instance, making it easy to edit code and manage files in the cloud.  
- **GitHub**: All my web app code is stored and versioned in this GitHub repository.  
- **AWS CodeArtifact**: CodeArtifact stores my artifacts and dependencies, which helps with high availability and speeds up my project’s build process.  
- **AWS CodeBuild**: Once it’s rolled out, CodeBuild will take over my build process. It will compile the source code, run tests, and produce ready-to-deploy software packages automatically.
